The 16 scripts are the algorithms compared in the first paper. The algorithm 13 is the one introduced in the second paper, and 14 to 16 are variants of 13.

## Data
Please download examplary data here: 
> ftp://ftp.lrz.de/transfer/temporary_data_storage/

Place the "data" directory at the same level of "mani".

The referred data is the Berlin land cover land use data set used in these two papers, including an hyperspectral image and a Sentinel-1 dual-Pol data.

## Environment
The codes are tested with Matlab R2020b.
